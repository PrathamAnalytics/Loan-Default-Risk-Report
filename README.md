# Loan Default Risk Report

## Overview
This project explores the risk of loan default using a dataset containing borrower details, credit history, and loan purpose. The goal is to understand the patterns behind defaults and develop insights to help financial institutions minimize risk and improve their lending strategies.

## Objective
- To identify the key factors contributing to loan default.
- To build a data-driven risk assessment framework for credit evaluation.
- To deliver actionable business recommendations for better lending decisions.

## Purpose of the Project
Financial institutions often face challenges in identifying potentially risky borrowers. This project aims to:
- Analyze borrower behavior and demographic trends.
- Detect high-risk patterns using exploratory and statistical methods.
- Empower decision-makers with targeted, data-driven lending strategies.

## Technical Overview
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Techniques**: 
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering & Transformation
  - Outlier Handling & Missing Value Treatment
  - Correlation Analysis
  - Risk Segmentation
  - Actionable Recommendation Framework

## Top Insights
- Loan amount, credit score, and loan purpose are the **strongest predictors** of default.
- Borrowers with **low income** and loans for **medical/emergency purposes** default more frequently.
- **Home ownership** and **longer employment** are tied to **lower default risk**.
- Borrowers with **multiple open accounts** show increased risk, suggesting over-leverage.
- Interest rates offered **do not scale effectively** with borrower risk, indicating room for pricing optimization.

## EDA & Advanced Analysis
- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to explore default distributions.
- Analyzed relationships between credit history, employment status, income, and loan performance.
- Used correlation heatmaps and distribution plots to detect multicollinearity and feature importance.
- Identified significant class imbalances and feature engineering opportunities.

## Detailed & Actionable Recommendations

1. **Refine Credit Scoring with Multivariate Risk Factors**  
   Incorporate variables like income, employment length, home ownership, and loan purpose into credit scoring models to better predict risk.

2. **Segmented Interest Rate Strategy Based on Borrower Risk Profiles**  
   Implement tier-based pricing strategies to better reflect individual borrower risk and incentivize responsible behavior.

3. **Limit High Loan Amount Approvals for Risk-Prone Demographics**
