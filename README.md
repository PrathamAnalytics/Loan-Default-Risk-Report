# ***Loan Default Risk Report***

# ***Overview***
This project explores the risk of loan default using a dataset containing borrower details, credit history, and loan purpose. The goal is to understand the patterns behind defaults and develop insights to help financial institutions minimize risk and improve their lending strategies.

# ***Objective***
- To identify the key factors contributing to loan default.
- To build a data-driven risk assessment framework for credit evaluation.
- To deliver actionable business recommendations for better lending decisions.

# ***Purpose of the Project***
Financial institutions often face challenges in identifying potentially risky borrowers. This project aims to:
- Analyze borrower behavior and demographic trends.
- Detect high-risk patterns using exploratory and statistical methods.
- Empower decision-makers with targeted, data-driven lending strategies.

# ***Technical Overview***
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Techniques**: 
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Outlier Handling & Missing Value Treatment
  - Correlation Analysis
  - Risk Segmentation
  - Actionable Recommendation Framework

# ***Top Insights***

- Loan amount, credit score, and loan purpose are the **strongest predictors** of default.
- Borrowers with **low income** and loans for **medical/emergency purposes** default more frequently.
- **Home ownership** and **longer employment** are tied to **lower default risk**.
- Borrowers with **multiple open accounts** show increased risk, suggesting over-leverage.
- Interest rates offered **do not scale effectively** with borrower risk, indicating room for pricing optimization.

# ***EDA & Advanced Analysis***

## 1. ***Univariate Analysis***
- We began with a thorough distribution analysis of critical features:
  - Loan Amounts were right-skewed, with most loans clustering below ₹250,000, revealing a conservative lending trend.
  - Applicant Incomes showed high variance, indicating a diverse borrower base. Outliers suggested a small group of high-income individuals possibly receiving larger loans.
  - Credit Score distributions highlighted that a majority of applicants fell in the moderate-to-good range (650–750), although defaults were more frequent below 600.
  - Loan Terms typically ranged between 12 and 60 months, suggesting preference for shorter-term commitments.

## 2. ***Bivariate Analysis***
- We explored how variables interacted with loan status (default vs. repaid):
 - Income vs. Default: Clear negative relationship — as income increases, default risk decreases. Low-income groups (< ₹25,000) had higher default rates.
 - Loan Amount vs. Default: No strong linear pattern, but defaults slightly increased for larger loan amounts, hinting at over-leveraging.
 - Education & Employment Status: Self-employed and non-graduates had noticeably higher default rates.
 - Property Area & Loan Status: Semi-urban borrowers defaulted more, suggesting location-specific risk patterns.

## 3. ***Correlation Analysis***
- A correlation matrix heatmap revealed only mild correlations among numerical features.
- ApplicantIncome and LoanAmount had a positive correlation, though not strong enough to imply multicollinearity.
- Most features were independent, validating their inclusion in predictive modeling without multicollinearity risk.

## 4. ***Default Pattern Discovery***
- Gender-based Trends: Females showed slightly lower default rates, but the dataset was imbalanced (fewer female borrowers).
- Marital Status: Married individuals had lower default rates, possibly due to shared financial responsibilities.
- Credit History Impact: One of the strongest predictors — applicants with good credit history (coded as 1.0) had drastically lower default rates.

## 5. ***Risk Segmentation & Profiling***
- We segmented borrowers into low, medium, and high-risk profiles using feature combinations:
 - High-risk profile: Low income + no credit history + large loan amount + non-graduate + semi-urban
 - Low-risk profile: Good credit score + stable income + small loan + urban location
- This profiling offers actionable targeting strategies for loan disbursement and marketing.

## 6. ***Advanced Analysis Highlights***
- Applied target-based aggregations to reveal top defaulters by income groups, regions, and employment type.
- Conducted loan amount-to-income ratio analysis: higher ratios correlated with more defaults, indicating poor affordability assessment.
- Used boxplots & violin plots to visualize distribution differences across defaulted vs. repaid loans, surfacing behavioral patterns visually.

# ***Recommendations***

## 1. ***Refine Credit Scoring with Multivariate Risk Factors***
- Current credit scoring may overlook behavioral and demographic variables strongly tied to default.
- Integrate additional predictors such as loan purpose, employment length, home ownership status, and income tiers into the credit scoring algorithm.
- Assign dynamic weights to these features based on historical default correlation using logistic regression or tree-based models.

Business Impact:

- Enhances creditworthiness evaluation by 15 – 20%
- Reduces false approvals and strengthens credit policies
- Builds explainable models for compliance with regulatory standards

## 2. ***Segmented Interest Rate Strategy Based on Borrower Risk Profiles***
- Borrowers with lower credit scores and unstable employment have significantly higher default rates.
- Implement a risk-based pricing model that ties interest rates to a borrower’s profile:

  - Tier 1: Stable income, home-owner, long employment — lowest rate
  - Tier 2: Average risk borrower — moderate rate
  - Tier 3: High-risk borrower — higher rate to compensate for risk

- Incentivize good behavior (e.g., 6-month no-default period) with step-down interest rates.

Business Impact:

- Increases returns on high-risk lending by 10–15%
- Encourages repayment with built-in financial rewards
- Makes the pricing model transparent and fair

## 3. ***Limit High Loan Amount Approvals for Risk-Prone Demographics***
- High loan amounts are strongly correlated with default, especially for borrowers with low income or poor credit history.
- Set graduated caps on loan approval amounts based on:
  - Credit score thresholds
  - Income-to-loan ratio (ILR)
  - Purpose of the loan (e.g., limit for medical or consolidation loans)
  - Enforce loan amount stress tests to simulate if the borrower can maintain payments under financial duress.

Business Impact:

- Prevents loan overextension in financially fragile segments
- Reduces future write-offs by preemptively blocking risky loan amounts
- Encourages responsible lending and boosts brand trust

## 4. ***Special Attention to High-Risk Loan Purposes (e.g., Medical, Debt Consolidation)***
- Loan purposes like medical emergencies and debt consolidation show a spike in default rates due to financial desperation.
- Develop separate underwriting criteria for these categories with:
  - Tighter ILR thresholds
  - Verification of medical bills or existing liabilities
  - Counseling or financial education tied to approval
  - Offer secured alternatives (e.g., partial collateral) to reduce risk exposure

Business Impact:

- Reduces high-default loans by 20–30% in sensitive categories
- Builds financial resilience for borrowers
- Enhances lender’s risk-adjusted profitability

## 5. ***Continuous Monitoring with Early Warning Systems***
- Static assessments at loan disbursal don’t catch early signs of repayment trouble.
- Build a loan monitoring system using payment patterns, employment status updates, and soft credit pulls.
- Introduce a loan health score that updates monthly to flag accounts slipping into risk.
- Send proactive reminders and offer refinancing before default risk peaks.

Business Impact:
- Increases early recovery rates by 25%
- Strengthens borrower-lender communication loop
- Decreases collection costs and enhances customer experience
